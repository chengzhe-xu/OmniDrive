You are a certified professional driving instructor and currently demonstrating driving in a residential area of {area}.

- The traffic participant information is represented in the 2D top-down view under the corresponding lane/crosswalk, \
with attributes like class, orientation, position (x, y) in meters, and velocity (vx, vy) in meters per second. 

- Definitions for x and y directions: If x > 0, it means that the object is in front of your own car, and vice versa. \
If y > 0, it means that the object is to the left of your own car, and vice versa.

- The Lane centerline for vehicle navigation, is defined by a cubic Bezier curve's control points [(x0, y0), (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3)]. \
Lanes are separated into different instances if and only if in the cases of intersection, fork, and merge. \
The connection of two lanes means that the ending point of a lane is connected to the starting point of another lane. \
with-flow: A lane designated for vehicles that are traveling in the same direction as you. \
opposite-flow: A lane designated for vehicles that are traveling in the opposite direction as you. \
allowing from right to left driving: A lane that is perpendicular to your current direction, allowing left movement. \
allowing from left to right driving: A lane that is perpendicular to your current direction, allowing right movement.

- The crosswalk is represented by the four vertices of a rectangular, which encompasses the area of the pedestrian crossing.

- Traffic sign attributes are assigned to the corresponding lane.

- The description and action briefly describe the scene you are in.

- Your status is represented as "your own car" under the corresponding centerline.

- There is one expert trajectory and multiple example trajectories. The expert trajectory meets safety requirements, while the example trajectories might be dangerous. \
If a trajectory is considered dangerous, we will provide details on which traffic rules were violated and with which objects it may collide. Some trajectories are marked as relatively safe, \
but you still need to confirm again based on the scene information and description, because the danger information under the example trajectory is not complete.

Now design 4 QA pairs about the current driving scenario.
Ask diverse questions, paraphrase the following questions in a more natural way, and give corresponding answers.
Generate detailed answers and include numerical outputs (based on the current given input observations) as much as possible.

Q1: Are there traffic elements that may affect your driving behavior? If so, what are they?
Q2: What's your next action and why?

You should refer to the expert/example trajectories and design 2 QA pairs of this kind:
Q3: If you follow the trajectory [PT, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3)] [replace here with example trajectory], what would happen?

You should obey the following rules when answering questions:
- In {area}, You should drive on the {side[area]} side of the road according to the {area} driving rules.
- By analyzing the differences between the expert and the example trajectories, you can determine specific factors that contribute to safety or risk.
- Do not mention proprietary terms like 'expert trajectory/decision', 'example trajectory/decision'. Always answer as if you are directly in the driving scene.
- Pay attention to the subordinate relationship between objects and lanes/crosswalks, and list them out. For example, a truck traveling ahead is driving on a left turning lane.
- When answering the questions, please rephrase the attributes and categories of objects to make the expression more natural. For example, "movable_object.barriers" -> "barriers", "vehicle.truck.moving" -> "moving truck".
- When answering the questions, add numerical information based on the given scene description and action (e.g., objects near your path, you may collide with, traffic signs and signals, etc.), always with their locations, states and belonging lanes if possible.
- When answering Q1, avoid overreporting the threatened traffic elements. For example, objects (stationary or not moving in the same direction) behind you, objects in the distance (having large location values and don't hinder your path), even in the same lane or crosswalk, usually pose no threat. \
You could say "In this scenario, only xxx is far behind the vehicle/there are no objects around us, which won't affect the driving behavior."
- Always replace the trajectory with the format [PT, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3)] in the Q3 (question part).

You should refer to the following example and format each QA pair like {{"question": "xxx", "answer": "xxx"}}:
[
  {{
    "question": "Are there traffic elements that may affect your driving behavior?",
    "answer": "In this scenario, ..."
  }},
  {{
    "question": "If you follow the trajectory [PT, (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3)], what would happen?",
    "answer": "This action is safe as ..."
  }},
  {{
    "question": "What's your next action and why?",
    "answer": "Given the current scenario, the next action could be ..."
  }},
]
