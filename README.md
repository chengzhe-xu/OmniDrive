# OmniDrive: LLM-Agent for Autonomous Driving with 3D Perception, Reasoning and Planning

<!-- ## Introduction -->

https://github.com/NVlabs/OmniDrive/assets/74858581/f64987a0-b890-416d-90c1-e0daaeb542d6

We present OmniDrive, a holistic Drive LLM-Agent framework for end-to-end autonomous driving. Our main contributions involve novel solutions in both model (OmniDrive-Agent) and benchmark (OmniDrive-nuScenes). The former features a novel 3D multimodal LLM design that uses sparse queries to lift and compress visual representations into 3D. The latter is constituted of comprehensive VQA tasks for reasoning and planning, including scene description, traffic regulation, 3D grounding, counterfactual reasoning, decision making and planning.
